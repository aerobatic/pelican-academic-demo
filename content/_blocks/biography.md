Professor Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore was the Transfiguration Professor, and later Headmaster of [Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Hogwarts_School_of_Witchcraft_and_Wizardry). Professor Dumbledore also served as Supreme Mugwump of the [International Confederation of Wizards](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/International_Confederation_of_Wizards) and Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot. He was a half-blood, Muggle-supporting wizard, the son of Percival and Kendra Dumbledore, and the elder brother of Aberforth and Ariana. His father died in Azkaban when Dumbledore was young, while his mother and sister were later accidentally killed. His early losses greatly affected him early on, even at his death, but in turn made him a better person. Albus Dumbledore was considered to be the most powerful wizard of all time. He was most famous for his defeat of [Gellert Grindelwald](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Gellert_Grindelwald), the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon's blood, and his work on alchemy with Nicolas Flamel.

It was through Dumbledore that resistance to the rise of [Lord Voldemort](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Tom_Riddle) was formed, as it was he who founded and led both the first and second Order of the Phoenix. Due to the fact that he had a keen mind and legendary power, Dumbledore became the only wizard that Voldemort ever feared. He was the wielder and the master of the Elder Wand from 1945 until 1997 and considered by many as the greatest Headmaster to ever grace Hogwarts. As he was about to die by a cursed ring, he planned his own death with Severus Snape. He was killed by Snape during the Battle of the Astronomy Tower.
